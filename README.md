## Problems faced during installation on windows
* If your build is qutie slow install ember-clid-windows which will disable windows defenders to watch your project directory, dont forget to run execution policy comman from : https://github.com/felixrieseberg/ember-cli-windows/issues/24
* If you are using sublime then it will observe your tmp directory which will break build repeatadely, disable it by using following options in user preference : 
	"atomic_save": false,
	"folder_exclude_patterns": [".svn", ".git", ".hg", "CVS", "tmp/class-*", "tmp/es_*", "tmp/jshinter*", "tmp/replace_*", "tmp/static_compiler*", "tmp/template_compiler*", "tmp/tree_merger*", "tmp/coffee_script*", "tmp/concat-tmp*", "tmp/export_tree*", "tmp/sass_compiler*"]
